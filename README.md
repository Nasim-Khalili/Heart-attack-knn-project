# **Heart Attack Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model to predict the **risk of heart attack** based on medical features. The dataset includes various patient characteristics (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.) and the target variable indicating whether the patient has had a heart attack.  

### **🔹 Features of the Project:**  
✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning  
✅ Feature scaling for optimal model performance  
✅ Optimization of **K value** for better accuracy  
✅ Model evaluation using **Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and classification metrics**  
✅ API implementation using **FastAPI** (optional)  
✅ Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time predictions (optional)

## **📂 Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project contains medical attributes of patients. Key features include:  

- **Age** – Patient's age  
- **Sex** – Gender (0: Female, 1: Male)  
- **Chest Pain Type** – Types of chest pain experienced  
- **Blood Pressure** – Resting blood pressure  
- **Cholesterol** – Serum cholesterol level  
- **Fasting Blood Sugar** – Blood sugar level after fasting  
- **ECG Results** – Electrocardiogram results  
- **Max Heart Rate** – Maximum heart rate achieved  
- **Exercise Induced Angina** – Whether exercise caused chest pain  
- **ST Depression** – ST depression induced by exercise  
- **Target** – (0: No heart attack, 1: Heart attack)
